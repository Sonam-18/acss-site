## Features

A collection of single purpose styling units for maximum reuse.

## Atomic CSS creates the UI you want

Atomic CSS is not a *out-of-the-box* solution that comes with an opinionated grid system or UI. What it gives you instead is the freedom to style things the way you want *without creating bloat*.

## Atomic CSS has no footprint

Unlike other libraries, the simple fact of including Atomizer into your project does not add *a single byte* to your style sheets.

## Atomic CSS is Gzip-friendly

Atomic CSS creates more redundancy in the markup than "semantic" classes; and more repetition means better compression ratio. From a few tests we ran, itâ€™s about 35% for semantic classes versus 48% for Atomic classes.

## Atomic CSS is libraries best-friend

Atomic CSS is the perfect solution for common template and component libraries such as:

<div class="spaceBetween">
    <img src="/public/images/react.svg" alt="React" width="100" />
    <img src="/public/images/ember.svg" alt="Ember" width="100" />
    <img src="/public/images/handlebars.svg" alt="Handlebars" width="100" />
    <img src="/public/images/dust.svg" alt="Dust" width="100" />
</div>
